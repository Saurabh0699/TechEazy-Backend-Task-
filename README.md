I have done backend task fully and here are some instructions to run it properly.
First you needed Java version 21 or above to successfull run this API.
When you are going to test the API on POSTMAN you must have to pass the TOKEN - 9246e2ee-a026-424f-94f7-e751351ec9a9.
If you want the permission to run it you have to pass this toket for authentication purpose becouse of JWT based login for student and admin done here.

I have done all task as well as Student & Subject can be add,update,detele and print all list.
To use this API user or admin have to register themself as their Role for login and access the data and perform their task.
A Student can enroll in multiple Subjects. This is typically implemented using a many-to-many relationship.
JWT Authentication: Ensure that your security configuration correctly handles JWT-based authentication.
